This is my first try with Yii to creating a simple network scanner.

To run this project you need to install <a href="https://nmap.org/">nmap</a> first.
You can get your propper version <a href="https://nmap.org/download.html">here</a>

Also you need to install a php package to cominucate with nmap. you can find it <a href="https://github.com/willdurand/nmap">here</a>

~~~
composer require willdurand/nmap
~~~

After that you can run the project as any other Yii projects.
